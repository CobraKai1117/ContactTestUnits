***How can I ensure that my code, program, or software is functional and secure?***
There are several ways this can be done. For functional purposes rigorous testing needs to be in place to ensure the program runs correctly. This involves both static and dynamic testing. An example of static testing would be manually reviewing the code checking for any errors. These would include errors such an incorrect conversion from string to number or the code contains an infinite loop. Dynamic testing allows testers to check for errors by seeing how the program reacts to various changes in the code. An example of dynamic testing would be unit tests.

There are several ways to ensure the code and program are secure. Adding exception handlers to properly handle potential errors reduces the chance of the program behaving in unexpected ways. Assigning user roles also helps secure the program. You wouldn't want a guest logging into a hotel system to be able to see the camera feed of the hotel. User roles determine which users can see what types of data. The program itself should ensure that all software interacting with it should be up to date. Having outdate software increases the chance of potential vulnerabilities being exploited by potential hackers.

***How do I interpret user needs and incorporate them into a program?***

Interpreting user needs is done through continuous feedback from stakeholders of a project. First you get a general idea of what the client wants. As you receive more information, you can be determine more specific features to be developed based on client needs. For example, a local bank may require a banking app for their web/mobile clients. Based on their needs, they would need an app that would allow their clients to securely access their accounts and perform banking operations such as making deposits. This app would require multiple databases to store items such as user accounts and transaction information. It would also require a UI layout for users to login to the site and interact with the app. These are broad features that can be broken further down into subprograms, classes and functions. Once these ideas are sufficiently fleshed out, you can then find ways to incorporate them into the program

***How do I approach designing software?***

This can be done in a similar fashion as before. Start with a broad idea of what the program does, then narrow down the specifics. You need to understand the system as a whole in the program. You also need to understand how parts of the program work in conjunction with each other and their relationships. This will determine what parts of the program have access to what types of data.
